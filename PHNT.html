<h3>"We have 4 operations and the number 4 is the reference for everything".</h3>

<h3>So in my mind the first thing that come to me was the translation for the number 4 to portuguese that is "quatro" but to focus on the phonetic sound of the "qua" from the "quatro" word.</h3>

<h3>Then base on the phonetic sound of the "qua" from "quatro" word I correlate the other word that was "quadrado" base on the "qua" also.</h3>

<h3>Finally using the same pattern the last word that came to me was "square" because of the sound also of the "qua".</h3>

<h3>The phonetic correlation of the three "qua" should appear to you at this point.</h3>

<h3>My first guess was "time square" but was wrong ❌ and then I think "there is another square but im not remembering the name" and then I remember the name that was "union square" and I solve the challenge.✅</h3>

<h3>Well I cannot just guess stuff, I also need to prove it, so I went for google dorking and found the bellow result confirming the location.</h3>

<h3>I decided to give a name to this and a definition since I tried to find stuff related to this and I couldnt.</h3>

<h3>Also I found the below article from the University of Cambridge that explains a little bit in a different approach about this stuff.</h3>
